# Linear-Regression

## What is Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (what you're trying to predict) and one or more independent variables 
(factors that influence the dependent variable). It assumes a linear relationship between these variables, meaning that changes in the independent variables lead to 
proportional changes in the dependent variable.

## Key Concepts
1. Dependent Variable (y): The variable you want to predict (target variable).
2. Independent Variable(s) (x): The variable(s) used to predict the dependent variable (predictor variable(s)).
3. Model Equation: y = b0 + b1*x + ε (for simple linear regression with one independent variable)

    b0: The y-intercept (the predicted value of y when x is zero).
   
    b1: The slope (the amount of change in y for a one-unit change in x).
   
    ε: The error term (accounts for random noise or unexplained variance).

5. Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): A statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s). Values closer to 1 represent a stronger linear relationship.

## About Dataset
The data contains the following columns:

1. 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
2. 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
3. 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
4. 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
5. 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
6. 'Price': Price that the house sold at
7. 'Address': Address for the house
